## Step 1: Check for the `hosts` File

1. **Navigate to the `hosts` File Location**
    - Open File Explorer.
    - Go to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.

2. **Check for the `hosts` File**
    - Ensure that the `hosts` file is present in the directory.
    - If the file is missing or appears corrupted, proceed to the next steps.

<Warning>
Modifying the `hosts` file requires administrative privileges. Make sure you have the necessary permissions.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Restore the `hosts` File

#### Method 1: Restore Default `hosts` File

1. **Open Notepad as Administrator**
    - Click the `Start` button or press the `Windows` key.
    - Type `Notepad` in the search bar.
    - Right-click on `Notepad` and select `Run as administrator`.

2. **Create a Default `hosts` File**
    - Copy and paste the following default content into Notepad:

    ```plaintext
    # Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
    #
    # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
    #
    # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
    # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
    # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
    # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
    # space.
    #
    # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
    # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
    #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

    # localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
    #       127.0.0.1       localhost
    #       ::1             localhost
    ```

3. **Save the `hosts` File**
    - Click `File` > `Save As`.
    - Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.
    - In the `Save as type` dropdown, select `All Files`.
    - Name the file `hosts` and click `Save`.

#### Method 2: Restore Using Command Prompt

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
    - Click the `Start` button or press the `Windows` key.
    - Type `cmd` in the search bar.
    - Right-click on `Command Prompt` and select `Run as administrator`.

2. **Restore the `hosts` File**
    - Run the following command to restore the default `hosts` file:

    ```sh
    echo 127.0.0.1 localhost > C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    echo ::1 localhost >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    ```

<Note>
If you have custom entries in your `hosts` file, make sure to back them up before restoring the default file.
</Note>

## Step 3: Verify and Test

1. **Verify the `hosts` File**
    - Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` and open the `hosts` file in Notepad to verify its contents.

2. **Test the Fix**
    - Restart your computer.
    - Check if the XBX-ERR-001 error is resolved.

## Additional Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after restoring the `hosts` file, consider the following additional steps:

1. **Check File Permissions**
    - Ensure that the `hosts` file has the correct permissions.
    - Right-click on the `hosts` file, select `Properties`, and go to the `Security` tab.
    - Ensure that your user account has full control.

2. **Scan for Malware**
    - Run a full system scan using your antivirus software to check for malware that might be corrupting the `hosts` file.

3. **Update Windows**
    - Ensure that your Windows operating system is up to date by checking for updates in `Settings` > `Update & Security` > `Windows Update`.
