## Repair Windows

To repair Windows and fix ATT-ERR-001, you need to run a series of commands in Command Prompt with administrator privileges. 

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
    - Click the `Start` button or press the `Windows` key.
    - Type `cmd` in the search bar.
    - Right-click on `Command Prompt` from the search results and select `Run as administrator`.

    ```

    - Wait for the scan to complete. This process may take some time.

</Note>

3. **Run Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) Commands**
    - After the SFC scan completes, run the following DISM commands one by one. Make sure to wait for each command to finish before running the next one.

    ```sh
    Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
    ```

    ```sh
    Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
    ```

    - This command scans the Windows image for any corruption.

    ```sh
    Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
    ```

    - This command repairs the Windows image. 

<Warning>
Running DISM commands can take a significant amount of time. Do not interrupt the process.
