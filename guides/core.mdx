    ```sh
    sigverif
    ```

2. **Update or Remove Incompatible Drivers**
    - Update the drivers from the manufacturerâ€™s website or, if necessary, uninstall the incompatible drivers through Device Manager.

### Edit Registry (Advanced)

Editing the registry can have serious consequences if not done correctly. Proceed with caution and consider backing up the registry first.

1. **Open Registry Editor**
    - Press `Windows + R`, type `regedit`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to the Core Isolation Key**
    - Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`.

3. **Modify the Value**
    - Double-click the `Enabled` entry and change its value to `0`.

4. **Restart Your Computer**
    - Restart your computer to apply the changes.
